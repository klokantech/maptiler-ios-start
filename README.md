==================

MapTiler iOS Start

Usage:
------

Create a copy of the project on your Mac with XCode installed.
You can do that by running this command in the Terminal:

`git clone --recursive git@github.com:klokantech/maptiler-ios-start.git`

Open the project in XCode and press on Build.

The project contains a map.mbtiles file. If you replace it with your own map rendered by MapTiler it will run just fine.

Compiled application allows zooming and panning on the map. It is ready for both iPhone and iPad.

The map is compiled into the app and therefore it is available even if the user of the app is offline, without internet connection.

The application has the standard control for showing your position on the map and rotating the map - with the support of GPS, mobile triangulation and sensors available in the device.
